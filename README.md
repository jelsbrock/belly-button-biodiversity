# Belly Button Biodiversity
The intent of this project was to build an interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity that occurs within human navels. 

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
